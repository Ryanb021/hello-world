            <p> A martial art developed in the Ryukyu Kingdom. It developed from the indigenous Ryukyuan martial arts (called te (æ‰‹), "hand"; tii in Okinawan) under the influence of Chinese martial arts, particularly Fujian White Crane. Karate is now predominantly a striking art using punching, kicking, knee strikes, elbow strikes and open-hand techniques such as knife-hands, spear-hands and palm-heel strikes.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karate">Source</a></p>
